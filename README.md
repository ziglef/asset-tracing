# Asset Tracing on a Distributed Multimedia Production Environment

The purpose of this project is to create a software module that enables a distributed multimedia production system that is running one or more mxfSpeedrail machines to analyse their file system and easily extract information from it.

For that purpose we use graph databases as a way to store and query data.
